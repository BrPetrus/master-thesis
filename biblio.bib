    abstract = {Automated detection of curvilinear structures, e.g., blood
        vessels or nerve fibres, from medical and biomedical images is a crucial
            early step in automatic image interpretation associated to the
            management of many diseases. Precise measurement of the
            morphological changes of these curvilinear organ structures informs
            clinicians for understanding the mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment
            of e.g. cardiovascular, kidney, eye, lung, and neurological
            conditions. In this work, we propose a generic and unified
            convolution neural network for the segmentation of curvilinear
            structures and illustrate in several 2D/3D medical imaging
            modalities. We introduce a new curvilinear structure segmentation
            network (CS2-Net), which includes a self-attention mechanism in the
            encoder and decoder to learn rich hierarchical representations of
            curvilinear structures. Two types of attention modules - spatial
            attention and channel attention - are utilized to enhance the
            inter-class discrimination and intra-class responsiveness, to
            further integrate local features with their global dependencies and
            normalization, adaptively. Furthermore, to facilitate the
            segmentation of curvilinear structures in medical images, we employ
            a 1×3 and a 3×1 convolutional kernel to capture boundary features.
            Besides, we extend the 2D attention mechanism to 3D to enhance the
            network’s ability to aggregate depth information across different
            layers/slices. The proposed curvilinear structure segmentation
            network is thoroughly validated using both 2D and 3D images across
            six different imaging modalities. Experimental results across nine
            datasets show the proposed method generally outperforms other
            state-of-the-art algorithms in various metrics.}
