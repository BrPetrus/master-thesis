    abstract = {Automated detection of curvilinear structures, e.g., blood
        vessels or nerve fibres, from medical and biomedical images is a crucial
            early step in automatic image interpretation associated to the
            management of many diseases. Precise measurement of the
            morphological changes of these curvilinear organ structures informs
            clinicians for understanding the mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment
            of e.g. cardiovascular, kidney, eye, lung, and neurological
            conditions. In this work, we propose a generic and unified
            convolution neural network for the segmentation of curvilinear
            structures and illustrate in several 2D/3D medical imaging
            modalities. We introduce a new curvilinear structure segmentation
            network (CS2-Net), which includes a self-attention mechanism in the
            encoder and decoder to learn rich hierarchical representations of
            curvilinear structures. Two types of attention modules - spatial
            attention and channel attention - are utilized to enhance the
            inter-class discrimination and intra-class responsiveness, to
            further integrate local features with their global dependencies and
            normalization, adaptively. Furthermore, to facilitate the
            segmentation of curvilinear structures in medical images, we employ
            a 1×3 and a 3×1 convolutional kernel to capture boundary features.
            Besides, we extend the 2D attention mechanism to 3D to enhance the
            network’s ability to aggregate depth information across different
            layers/slices. The proposed curvilinear structure segmentation
            network is thoroughly validated using both 2D and 3D images across
            six different imaging modalities. Experimental results across nine
            datasets show the proposed method generally outperforms other
            state-of-the-art algorithms in various metrics.}

    abstract = {Curvilinear object segmentation is a paramount step for many applications ranging from medical to aerial image processing. In particular, vessel segmentation in retinal images, detection of spiculated lesions in mammograms or extraction of airways in CT scans provide essential information to experts to evaluate, diagnose and propose a treatment. The significance of these applications has conducted important efforts to propose curvilinear object segmentation algorithms based on the most different techniques. The main objective of this review is to clearly present the similarities and differences between curvilinear structures in different applications and the different techniques used to segment them more effectively. To do so, we propose a general definition of curvilinear structures that encompasses the distinct models considered in the literature. In addition, we analyse and classify the mathematical techniques used to segment the curvilinear structures found across all considered applications, studying their strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we present the most relevant benchmarks related to curvilinear object segmentation as well as the best algorithms according to several performance measures. By doing so, it is acquired a wider point of view to extend the results from some fields to others, and to understand under which conditions some methodologies should be favoured over the rest of them.}

    abstractNote={The curvilinear structure detection is widely applied in many
        real tasks, such as the fiber classification, river finding, blood
            vessel detection, and so on. In this paper, we proposed to use the
            ridge-based curvilinear structure detection (RCSD) for the road
            extraction from the remote sensing images. First, we employed the
            morphology trivial opening operation to filter out almost all the
            small clusters of noise and the small paths. Then RCSD was used to
            find the road from the remote sensing images. The experiments showed
            that our proposed method is efficient and give better results than
            the current existing road-detection methods. Considering the similar
            structure between backbone in the neuron dendrite images and the
            road in remote sensing images, we extended the application of RCSD
            to the backbone detection in neuron dendrite images. The results on
            backbone detection also proved the efficiency of RCSD.},
